## The rules of Mill are as follows:

Mill (also known as Nine Men's Morris) is a traditional strategy game for two players. The game board consists of a grid with 24 intersections or "spots." Each player has 9 pieces of a specific color (usually white and black) that are placed alternately on the spots. The objective of the game is to form mills by placing three pieces in a row along a line.

  1. At the beginning of the game, each player has 9 pieces.

  2. Players take turns placing their pieces on the vacant spots of the game board. Pieces can only be placed on empty spots.

  3. Once all the pieces have been placed, players can move their pieces from one adjacent spot to another along the lines.

  4. A player can capture an opponent's piece by moving their own piece to an adjacent spot that is connected to the opponent's piece and is vacant.

  5. When a player forms a mill by placing three of their pieces in a row along a line, they are allowed to remove one of the opponent's pieces that       is not part of a mill. The removed piece is taken out of play and cannot be used again.

  6. The game ends when one player has fewer than 3 pieces remaining or when a player is unable to make a move.
