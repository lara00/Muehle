  Field 1 is symmetric to field 24, field 2 to field 23, field 3 to field 22, and so on.
  Any two adjacent fields always have the same possible ways to move to the next field, but with different signs.
  For example, it is possible to move from field 1 to field 2, and from field 1 to field 10 by adding 1 (+1) and 9 (+9), respectively.
  Similarly, we can use the symmetry of a MÃ¼hle field to calculate the numbers between fields. For example, since 25 - 24 = 1 and 25 - 13 = 12,
  we can use the option from field 1 to field 12 to calculate the numbers from field 13 to field 24.
